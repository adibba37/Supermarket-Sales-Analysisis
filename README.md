# Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Supermarket Sales Data

This repository contains code and data for conducting data analysis and machine learning on a dataset of Supermarket sales records. The dataset includes various attributes such as Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer type, Gender, Product line, Unit price, Quantity, Tax 5%, Total, Date, Time, Payment method, COGS, Gross Margin Percentage, Gross Income, and Customer Rating.

## Data Analysis:

+ Exploratory data analysis (EDA) has been performed to gain insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics.
+ Key visualizations using Python, Matplotlib and Seaborn library have been created to understand the data distribution, sales performance by product line, customer behavior, payment method usage, seasonal trends, and more.
+ Metrics such as total sales, revenue, average rating, COGS, quantity sold, and gross income have been calculated and summarized.


## Machine Learning:
+ A simple linear regression model has been implemented using scikit-learn to predict "Total" sales based on "Unit price," "Quantity," and "Tax 5%" features.
+ The model's performance has been evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
